# Factorial

This is a simple program to calculate the factorial of a number.

## Assignment Instructions

This project is part of a programming assignment. Below are the instructions for the assignment:

- Write a function that calculates a factorial.
- Required signature: func Factorial(int) (uint64, error). You can implement a recursive, iterative, or both implementations with a BenchmarkFactorial for comparison (bonus).
- Define and use public constant error returns (negative, overflow).
- Write an opaque table-driven test (hint: t.Run) covering various cases for a 100% coverage rate S0 and C0.

## Running the tests

```bash
go test -v
```
